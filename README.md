# Dungeon Adventure Game

Welcome to the Dungeon Adventure Game! This is a simple, text-based adventure game written in Python where you explore a dungeon, collect items, and solve puzzles to escape. The game is played by entering commands to move through different rooms, interact with objects, and use items.

## Features:
- Move between rooms (north, south, east, west).
- Pick up and use items found in the rooms.
- Track your inventory and use items to solve challenges.
- Simple text-based interface. 
 
## How to Play:
1. The game starts in the **Entrance** room of the dungeon.
2. You can move through rooms using commands like `go north`, `go south`, `go east`, or `go west`.
3. You can take items from the room using the command `take [item]`.
4. Type `inventory` to see the items you currently hold. 
5. The game ends when you reach the exit room.
